{"name":"jtools","tagline":"Manage your JVM-based tools with ease !","body":"## What is jtools ?\r\n\r\njtools is a set of scripts, available as a single command, to easily manage your favorite JVM-based tools:\r\nCurrently targeted at build tools, it support installation/upgrade/removal of :\r\n\r\n* Maven\r\n* SBT\r\n* Gradle\r\n* Leiningen\r\n\r\nHowever, feel free to suggest support for additional tools on [jtools's issue tracker](https://github.com/pdalpra/jtools/issues) !\r\n\r\n## Why use jtools when I can use a package manager ?\r\n\r\nThis is indeed a reasonable question.\r\n\r\nYou could very well use any package manager available for your OS.\r\nHowever, using a package manager has two huge flaws :\r\n\r\n* They are *so many* package managers, sometimes several per OS/distro, each using their own packaging format. It it hard to manage several computers with possibly different OSes in the same fashions as tools differs.\r\n* They depend on the good will of maintainers that will bundle new versions for each package manager\r\n\r\njtools hope to solve these issues (for JVM-based tools at least) by: \r\n\r\n* Relying only on bash scripts, with as few external dependencies as possible. ATM, only either wget/curl/httpie and Git are required, which are quite common tools for a developer :)\r\n* Installing directly from upstreams source, either through Git or by installing from the official distributions\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\nClone jtools :\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/pdalpra/jtools.git ~/.bin/jtools\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, in your `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`/your shell's startup file, add:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport PATH=$PATH:~/.bin/jtools/bin\r\neval $(jtools init -)\r\nexport PATH=$PATH:$(jtools path)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Structure\r\njtools exposes several subcommands, one for each supported tool :\r\n\r\n* `jtools maven`\r\n* `jtools gradle`\r\n* `jtools sbt`\r\n* `jtools lein`\r\n\r\nIn turn, each of those subcommands expose three subcommands :\r\n\r\n* `install`\r\n* `update`\r\n* `remove`\r\n\r\nThis subcommands allows you to either install, update or remove the selected tool.\r\n\r\n### Examples \r\n\r\nTo install all four tools, type :\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ jtools maven install\r\n$ jtools gradle install\r\n$ jtools sbt install\r\n$ jtools lein install \r\n```\r\n\r\n`update` and `remove` works in the same way as `install`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ jtools maven upgrade\r\n$ jtools gradle upgrade\r\n$ jtools sbt upgrade\r\n$ jtools lein upgrade \r\n```\r\n\r\n### `jtools maven home`\r\n\r\n`jtools maven` also offers and an additional subcommand, `home`, to easily export Maven's install path to the `M2_HOME` environment variable:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport M2_HOME=$(jtools maven home)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\njtools is licensed under the MIT license.
